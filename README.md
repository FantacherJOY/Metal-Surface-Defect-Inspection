# Metal-Surface-Defect-Inspection
It's a deep learning project which was used to classify Metal defect surfaces. Images were collected from NEU database and images was contained six types of defect. In below, the result is shown, where the first name was predicted by the model and the second name in the first bracket was actual the category of respective images. The goal was to find an image defects category. You can download the data set from here: http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/yunhyan/NEU_surface_defect_database.html . This dataset contains a single folder with 1800 data. If you want to implement this project the way I implemented, you first need to separate these datasets into six folders having 300 images of each. Then you are done just run the Notebook into your data directory you will get the same results. I hope you can also improve the model if you want by integrating with any transfer learning model.
