# Metal-Surface-Defect-Inspection
It's a deep learning project which was used to classify metal surface defects. Images were collected for this projects from NEU database which contains six types of defect. In below, the result is shown, where the first name is prediction from the model and the second name in bracket true  category of respective images. You can download the data set from here: https://www.kaggle.com/fantacher/neu-metal-surface-defects-data. 

This dataset contains a single folder with 1800 data. If you want to implement this project the way I implemented, you first need to separate these datasets into six folders having 300 images of each. Then you are done just run the Notebook into your data directory you will get the same results. I hope you can also improve the model if you want by integrating with any transfer learning model.
